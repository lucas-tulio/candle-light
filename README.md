Created in 48 hours as my entry to the BaconGameJam05, this is a top down 2D stealth game where the goal is to find an special book inside a dungeon.

Explore the area using WASD to move your character. Avoid getting in the line of sight of enemies by hiding behind walls. The longer you take, the weaker the lights will become, slowly making the game harder.

The game was created in Java using jwjgl and Slick2D. Map created with Tiled.



EDIT: now that the jam is finished, the following updates have been made:

- Improved LoS of enemies
- Player can now hold down shift to run
