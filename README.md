# Candle Light

Created in 48 hours as my entry to the Reddit Game Jam 5, this is a top down 2D stealth game where the goal is to find an special book inside a dungeon.

Explore the area using WASD to move your character and Shift to run. Avoid getting in the line of sight of enemies by hiding behind walls. The longer you take, the weaker the lights will become, slowly making the game harder.

The game was created in Java using lwjgl and Slick2D. Map created with Tiled.



EDIT: now that the jam is finished, the following updates have been made:

- Improved LoS of enemies
- Player can now hold down shift to run

## How to run the game

I've included all the necessary lib files inside the project. In order to import and run it in Eclipse, do the following:

1. Clone the project in your local machine or download the project .zip
2. Open Eclipse, go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
3. Select the "maze" project downloaded on step 1
4. Run the Project
