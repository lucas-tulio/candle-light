A top down 2D stealth game where the goal is to find an special book inside a dungeon.

Explore the area using WASD to move your character. Avoid getting in the line of sight of enemies by hiding behind walls. The longer you take, the weaker the lights will become, slowly making the game harder.

The game was created in Java using jwjgl and Slick2D. Map created with Tiled.

This game was my entry to the BaconGameJam05.

EDIT: now that the jam is finished, the following updates will be applied in the next few days:

- Fix LoS of enemies
- Improved character movement
